WGER NOTES

Dynamic Measurements:

When you call the front page, these are the APIs you hit
"GET /api/v2/meal/?plan=1 HTTP/1.1" 200 52
"GET /api/v2/nutritiondiary/?plan=1&limit=999 HTTP/1.1" 200 311
"GET /api/v2/setting-repetitionunit/ HTTP/1.1" 200 245
"GET /api/v2/setting-weightunit/ HTTP/1.1" 200 219

When you enter the bmi calculator screen:
Therefore, no APIS get called (super interesting, maybe we should add height to the database?)
If height is added to the database, then we can access it later to make it part of the measurement
"GET /en/nutrition/calculator/bmi/ HTTP/1.1" 200 31265
"GET /nutrition/calculator/bmi/chart-data HTTP/1.1" 302 0
"GET /en/nutrition/calculator/bmi/chart-data HTTP/1.1" 200 1031
"POST /en/nutrition/calculator/bmi/calculate HTTP/1.1" 200 53

Line 192 in urls.py has the weight-entry
we should run a "heightentry" as well to get height

We should also maybe look at adding height as a one time thing
